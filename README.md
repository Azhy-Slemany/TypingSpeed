## Get it

- Windows users can download the software [here](https://github.com/Azhy-Slemany/TypingSpeed/releases/download/win-1.0/TypingSpeed_Windows.zip), and then
extract the downloaded zip file on your desired folder, and then it's ready to use just open the folder and run the `TypingSpeed.bat` script, be careful that
 on some systems playing sound effects might cause to crash the application, so if that happened just mute the application using the mute speaker button on
 the bottom right.
 - MacOS users can download the software [here](https://github.com/Azhy-Slemany/TypingSpeed/releases/download/osx-1.0/TypingSpeed_MacOS.zip), and extract it on desired 
 location, and after that just open the folder and open the readme file to know how to run the application.
 - Linux users can download the software [here](https://github.com/Azhy-Slemany/TypingSpeed/releases/download/linux-1.0/TypingSpeed_Linux.zip), and extract it on desired
 location, and then run the shell script using the linux terminal.
 - For any other OS user, you can download the source code and build it yourself.

## Development

You can fork the source code and add features or edit the software under my license, this project has been built using IntelliJ Idea, and you can use any other
IDE to edit it, but you should edit some configurations to be able to edit it, read more about JavaFX projects [here](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/)
in case you had any problem editing the project, the used JDK version is 14.0.2 and the used JavaFX version is 11.0.2, and another library used for
parsing Json texts which can be found [here](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java).

## Bugs

There are some common bugs which I like to describe them, and I might fix them on later versions: -

- On Windows version there's a problem when typing capital letters, it count's them as a mistake and it will affect the accuracy but not the speed or the Errors.
- There are some problems when playing sound effects, sometimes they might cause the app to crash, 
I don't know why this happens I think it's a JavaFX.media module's problem.

## To-DO List

- Adding a history for saving daily progress.
- Making **Add New Text** types more understandable.
- Making OS specific standalone applications.
